# Usage

First create `subtitler_apikey.json` from the sample provided and enter your [Xunfei](http://www.xfyun.cn/) `apikey` and `appid`

Then, run command:

```bash
$ python3 subtitler.py
```
And then, just follow the instruction and input each prompt. Putting the video file in to the directory of those python files is recommended; by doing so, you just need to enter the filename and its suffix.

**Note: The suffix of the subtitle file should not be entered, since it will be automatically added in the filename, and the format of subtitle files generated by this tool is srt**

# Dev Mode
In *Dev Mode*, you can modify the parameter that will affect speech segmentation and save the segmented audio(please create *save_audio* folder manually). This mode is recommended since those arguments are needed to be modified accodring to certain audio in videos(the pace of speaking for instance).
